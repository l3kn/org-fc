#+TITLE: Card Types

* Normal Cards
During review, the heading is shown with its "Back" subheading
collapsed, when flipping the card, the back heading is shown,
then the user is asked to rate the review performance.

Positions: =front=
* Text-Input Cards
On review, the user is asked to type in a string which is then
compared to the one stored in the ~:ANSWER:~ property of the card.

*Currently text-input cards are treated the same as normal cards.*

Positions: =front=
** TODO Implement review / flip function

:END:
1. Prompt for user input
2. Compare to stored answer, show diff

Problem: how to show diff in hydra?
* Double Cards
Similar to normal cards, but reviewed both in the "Front -> Back"
direction and in the "Back -> Front" direction.

Positions: =front=, =back=
* Cloze Cards
The cards text contains one or more *holes*.  During review, one hole
is hidden while the text of (some) remaining ones is shown.

Flipping the card reveals the text of the hidden hole,
using ~org-fc-type-cloze-hole-face~ to highlight it.

Card titles can contain holes, too.

Positions: =0=, =1=, ...

When changing the order of holes in a cloze card or adding / removing
holes, make sure to run ~org-fc-update~ on the card to update the
review data table.

Cloze cards can have a number of sub-types.

** Deletion ~'deletion~
Only one hole is hidden.
** Enumerations ~'enumeration~
All holes *behind* the currently review one are hidden, too.

Useful for memorizing lists where the order of items is important.
** Single ~'single~
All holes besides the current one are hidden.

Useful for learning syntax or function names of a programming language
by using a =src= block in the card and marking parts of the code as
holes.
** Context ~'context~
Holes ~org-fc-type-cloze-context~ (default 1) around the currently
reviewed one are shown.

Useful for memorizing longer lists where the order of items is important.
** Hole Syntax
Deletions can have the following forms

- ~{{text}}~
- ~{{text}@id}~
- ~{{text}{hint}}~
- ~{{text}{hint}@id}~

~text~ should not contain any "}",
unless it is part of a ~$latex$~ block.
In this case, ~latex~ should not contain any "$".

Holes *inside* latex blocks are not handled correctly at the moment.
As a workaround, create multiple smaller latex blocks and wrap each in
a hole.
** Image Deletions
Due to an issue with invisible overlays, images inside cloze-holes are
not shown correctly during review if the image link directly follows
the opening ~{{~.

Adding spaces around the image link fixes this problem,
e.g. ~{{ [[file:my_image.png]] }}~.
* Compact Cards
For cards without a "Back" heading, the headline text is considered as
the front, the main text as the back.

This is useful for cards with a short front text, e.g. when learning
definitions of words.
* Defining Own Card Types
To define a custom card type,
you need to implement three functions:

- ~(...-init)~ to initialize a heading as a flashcard of this type,
  setting up the cards properties & review data.
  Should be marked as ~(interactive)~.
- ~(...-setup position)~ to setup ~position~ of the card for review
- ~(...-flip)~ to flip the card
- ~(...-update)~ to update the review data of the card, e.g. if a new
  hole is added to a cloze card

All of these are called with ~(point)~ on the cards heading.

Take a look at the =org-fc-type-<name>.el= files to see how these
functions could be implemented.
