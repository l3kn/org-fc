Org Flashcards
==============

Org-fc is a spaced-repetition system for Emacs' org-mode.

It allows you to mark headlines in a file as "flashcards", turning
pieces of knowledge you want to learn into a question-answer test.

These cards are reviewed at regular interval. After each review, the
next review interval is calculated based on how well you remembered
the contents of the card.
