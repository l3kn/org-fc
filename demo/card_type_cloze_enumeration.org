* Proof: Infinitude of Primes

Assume {{there are only finitely many primes $p_1, \ldots, p_n$}}.

Calculate {{the product $Q = p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$, which is not
divisible by any of the $p_i$}{quantity & property}}.

Then {{$Q$ itself is a prime not in the list, or it has a prime
factor not in the list}}.
