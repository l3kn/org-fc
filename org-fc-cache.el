;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Even with the AWK based indexer, indexing cards before each review
;; gets slow if there are a lot of files / cards.
;;
;; After running the indexer one time, file checksums are used to
;; determine which cache entries need to be updated, assuming only a
;; small subset of the flashcard files is changed between reviews,
;; this is much faster than building the full index each time.
