You can view this documentation in Emacs with ~M-x org-fc-help~.

* Introduction
Org-fc is a spaced-repetition system for Emacs' org-mode.

It allows you to mark headlines in a file as "flashcards", turning
pieces of knowledge you want to learn into a question-answer test.

These cards are reviewed at regular interval. After each review, a
[[file:repetition_spacing_algorithm.org][Repetition Spacing Algorithm]] is used to calculate the next interval
based on how well you remembered the contents of the card.
* Getting Started
Start by [[file:installation.org][installing org-fc]] using the package manager of your choice.

A file demonstrating all [[file:card_types.org][Card Types]] is included. ~M-x org-fc-demo~
starts a review of this file.

To create your own flashcards, create a heading in an org-mode file
and [[file:marking_headings_as_cards.org][mark it as a flashcard]], using either one of the
~org-fc-type-...-init~ commands (e.g. ~org-fc-type-normal-init~)
or the [[file:hydra.org][org-fc Hydra]] (e.g. =C-c f= to open it, =t= to initialize a
new card, =n= to select the normal card type).

Once you've created a bunch of cards, you can start a [[file:review.org][Review Session]]
with ~M-x org-fc-review~ (=C-c f r= in the hydra).

~M-x org-fc-dashboard~ (=C-c f m= in the hydra) opens a [[file:dashboard.org][Dashboard]]
with statistics on the flashcards in the system.

Before reviews and when opening the dashboard, you're asked to select
a [[file:review_contexts.org][Review Context]]. These can be used to group cards to review them
separately from each other, e.g. when learning multiple languages.

Note 1: The [[file:hydra.org][Hydra]] is not enabled by default, add ~(require
'org-fc-hydra)~ to your configuration to load it.

Note 2: Make sure to check out [[file:use_with_evil-mode.org][Use with Evil-Mode]] if you're using
evil-mode.

Note 3: Before starting the review, make sure to add the directory of
your org files to ~org-fc-directories~, e.g. via ~(setq
org-fc-directories '("/my-org-files/"))~
* Design Goals / Choices
- [[file:differences_from_other_flashcard_systems.org][Differences from Other Flashcard Systems]]
- Good [[file:performance.org][Performance]]
  - =awk= is used for quickly finding cards due for review,
    instead of relying on the slow org-element parser
- Support for multiple *positions* in a card / heading
- All relevant data kept in org files for easy version control
- Review directly on the source org file for easy editing of cards
  during review
* Advanced Topics
- [[file:components.org][Components]]
- [[file:alternative_applications.org][Alternative Applications]]
- [[file:extensions.org][Extensions]]
- [[file:customizing_org-fc.org][Customizing Org-Fc]]
