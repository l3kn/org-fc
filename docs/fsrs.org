* Requirements

- python >= 3.10

* Installation

The only dependency [[https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/py-fsrs][py-fsrs]] is included in org-fc as a git submodule.

For a new installation:
~git clone --recurse-submodules <repo_url>~.

To load the submodule for a previously cloned repo:

~git pull~
~git submodule update --init --recursive~

* Setup

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-fc)
(require 'org-fc-algo-fsrs)
#+end_src

When created new cards, you can now select between the new "fsrs6"
algorithm and the old "sm2" variant.

* Migrating Cards

Cards can be migrated to the new algorithm, but a similar migration to
the old algorithm is not possible. Make sure to back up files before
migrating their cards if you want to preserve a copy of the old
~:REVIEW_DATA:~.

~M-x org-fc-algo-fsrs6-migrate~ migrates the card at point to FSRS.
~M-x org-fc-algo-fsrs6-migrate-buffer~ migrates all cards in the
current buffer to FSRS.

Both commands will also affect cards that already use FSRS and should
not change any parameters of the card except for random fluctuations
in the due dates which are to be expected.
