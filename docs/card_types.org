* Normal Cards

The simplest type of card has a front side with a question and a back
side with an answer.

[[file:../images/card_type_normal_create.svg]]

The "Front" heading can have any title but the "Back" heading must
have one of a defined set of titles ~org-fc-back-heading-titles~. By
default only "Back" is allowed.

The card can be initialized with ~M-x org-fc-type-normal-init~.

[[file:../images/card_type_normal_init.svg]]
Cards of this type have one position: =front=

During review, the "Back" heading is collapsed and will be expanded
when flipping the card.

Flipping the card via the =[RET]= key or ~M-x org-fc-review-flip~

* Text-Input Cards
If the card has a "Back" heading, the first line of its contents is
considered as the expected answer.

If the card is compact (has no back heading), the first line of its
main content is used instead.

This allows adding an e.g. explanation to the card.

Answers can be emphasized (e.g. ~foo~).  In that case, only the text
between the emphasis markers is compared to the user input.

On reviewing the card, the users are prompted to enter their answer,
which is then compared to the expected answer.

The expected answer is overlayed with "<got> (expected: <expected>)",
coloring correct parts in green and incorrect parts in red.

If the provided answer is shorter than the expected one, a sequence of
=-= (colored in red) is prepended / appended to it.

This filler character can be customized via ~org-fc-diff-missing-char~.

Positions: =front=
* Double Cards
Similar to normal cards, but reviewed both in the "Front -> Back"
direction and in the "Back -> Front" direction.

[[file:../images/card_type_double_create.svg]]

=M-x org-fc-type-double-init=

[[file:../images/card_type_double_init.svg]]

Positions: =front=, =back=

During review either the text under the front or under the back
heading will be hidden.

** Review, Front -> Back

* Cloze Cards
The cards text contains one or more *holes*.  During review, one hole
is hidden while the text of (some) remaining ones is shown.

[[file:../images/card_type_cloze_create.svg]]

=M-x org-fc-type-double-init=

[[file:../images/card_type_cloze_init.svg]]

Positions are numbered, starting from =0=. During review one of the
holes is hidden. The behavior of the other holes depends on the
sub-type of the card.

[[file:../images/card_type_cloze_review.svg]]

Flipping the card reveals the text of the hidden hole,
using ~org-fc-type-cloze-hole-face~ to highlight it.

[[file:../images/card_type_cloze_review_flip.svg]]

Card titles can contain holes, too.

** Deletion ~'deletion~
Only one hole is hidden.
** Enumerations ~'enumeration~
All holes *behind* the currently review one are hidden, too.

Useful for memorizing lists where the order of items is important.
** Single ~'single~
All holes besides the current one are hidden.

Useful for learning syntax or function names of a programming language
by using a =src= block in the card and marking parts of the code as
holes.
** Context ~'context~
Holes ~org-fc-type-cloze-context~ (default 1) around the currently
reviewed one are shown.

Useful for memorizing longer lists where the order of items is important.
** Hole Syntax
Deletions can have the following forms

- ~{{text}}~
- ~{{text}@id}~
- ~{{text}{hint}}~
- ~{{text}{hint}@id}~

~text~ should not contain any "}",
unless it is part of a ~$latex$~ block.
In this case, ~latex~ should not contain any "$".

Holes *inside* latex blocks are not handled correctly at the moment.
As a workaround, create multiple smaller latex blocks and wrap each in
a hole.
** Image Deletions
Due to an issue with invisible overlays, images inside cloze-holes are
not shown correctly during review if the image link directly follows
the opening ~{{~.

Adding spaces around the image link fixes this problem,
e.g. ~{{ [[file:my_image.png]] }}~.
** LaTeX in Cloze Deletions
LaTeX code in cloze delections can't contain a ~}}~,
to work around this limitation, insert a space between the braces.

Example: ~\frac{1}{\sqrt{2} }~
* Compact Cards
For cards without a "Back" heading, the headline text is considered as
the front, the main text as the back.

This is useful for cards with a short front text, e.g. when learning
definitions of words.
* Defining Own Card Types
To define a custom card type,
you need to implement three functions:

- ~(...-init)~ to initialize a heading as a flashcard of this type,
  setting up the cards properties & review data.
  Should be marked as ~(interactive)~.
- ~(...-setup position)~ to setup ~position~ of the card for review
- ~(...-flip)~ to flip the card
- ~(...-update)~ to update the review data of the card, e.g. if a new
  hole is added to a cloze card

All of these are called with ~(point)~ on the cards heading.
* Alternative Titles of the Back Heading

By default org-fc expects the heading for the back side of a card to
be named “Back”.

Custom names can be added via the ~org-fc-back-heading-titles~ variable.
