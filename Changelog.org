* Changelog
I hope the current card / log format is flexible enough to accommodate
upcoming changes.

In case a update to the org sources is needed, I'll add a changelog
entry with updating instructions.

** 0.6.3

*** Fixed

Properties implemented using the ~org-fc-property~ macro now check if
org-mode is active in the current buffer before trying to read the
value from org heading properties.

** 0.6.2

*** Fixed

When using =grep= to find files that contain flashcards, org-fc now
also finds files where the property drawer or single properties are
indented (preceded by spaces or tabs).

** 0.6.1

*** Fixed

- The overview of SM2 parameters in the dashboard works again.
- The ~org-fc-cache~ is now initialized from the ~org-fc-directories~
  rather than computing a list of changed files that potentially
  exceeds the number of arguments we can pass to the AWK indexer.

*** Changed

Org-fc only searches for files containing flashcards, improving the
indexing performance if the ~org-fc-directories~ contain many files
without flashcards.

*** Internal

Both the AWK and cache indexers filter out files without any
flashcards from their results.

** 0.6.0

This version of org-fc adds support for multiple spacing algorithms
(as long as they provide a due date to schedule cards by)
with a minimal amount of user-facing changes.

*** Changed

New cards are now initialized with a new ~FC-ALGO~ property,
defaulting to ~sm2~.

When creating new cards and if there is more than one algorithm
besides the internal ~noop~ algorithm, the user is prompted for the
spacing algorithm to use.

*** Added

Inside Emacs, ~M-x org-fc-help~ opens a buffer with the org-fc
documentation.

A new ~noop~ spacing algorithm has been implemented. It is used in the
~org-fc-demo~ so the demo cards stay due and their histories are not
logged. This algorithm is intended only for internal use but its
implementation can serve a simple point for users intending to
implement new spacing algorithms.

*** Fixed

Review-context filters now work correctly with the AWK indexer.

*** Internal

The functions for computing review statistics have been moved to the
algorithm implementation and a new function has been added that
allows reading the review history of a card or position.

** 0.5.1

Added missing import for ~eieio-base~.

** 0.5.0

*** Added

- =org-fc-audio= now allows attaching audio files to single positions
  of a card. Please refer to [[file:docs/extensions.org]] for more
  information.

- A new command ~org-fc-audio-stop~ can be used to stop
  audio playback.

- Flashcards can now use a new optional =FC_ALGO= property. When
  unset, this defaults to the original SM2 algorithm. Currently now
  alternative algorithms have been implemented but this will make it
  easier to support those in the future.

*** Changed

- =org-fc-audio= playback now stops when flipping the card, reviewing
  a new card or quitting the review.

*** Internal

- The initial SM2 parameters are now formatted the same way as the
  parameters written after a review. This does not affect the behavior
  of org-fc but is more consistent.

- The review history file is written to after each review, not once at
  the end of the review session. Again this should make no difference
  for users of org-fc while making it easier to implement alternative
  spacing algorithms

- Tests use a custom set of macros for mocking function calls to avoid
  a dependency on =el-mock=

** 0.4.0

*** Added

**** Review Orders

Review-context definitions can now include an optional
~:order~ property. Currently two orders are supported:

- ~'ordered~
  cards are reviewed file by file, in the order they appear within the
  file
- ~'shuffled~
  cards are reviewed in a randomized order

This corresponds to setting the existing ~org-fc-shuffle-positions~
variable to ~nil~ or ~t~ respectively, the only change being that this
can now be customized for each review context.

**** Mixed Line Endings

Some operating systems differ in how they mark line endings, using
either =\n= or =\r\n=. Usually =gawk= will use the correct ending for
the current OS but files moved from one OS to the other might not get
parsed correctly.

A new configuration variable ~org-fc-awk-mixed-line-endings~ can now
be set to a non-nil value to change the row-separator used by AWK to
support both kinds of line endings.

*** Internal
**** Use of ~eieio~

The internal data structures representing files, cards and positions
of cards have now use ~eieio~ classes.

The way org-fc reads and writes the contents of the ~:REVIEW_DATA:~
drawer has been changed as a first step towards supporting alternative
spacing algorithms.

To reduce the chance that bugs are introduced by this and future
changes of the code, end-to-end tests have been added to ensure
different functions of org-fc correctly change the org-mode contents
of flashcards.

**** AWK

Incorrect quoting in the field separator used for parsing
~:REVIEW_DATA:~ tables caused the inclusion of an extra field for each
"|" character between cells of the table. This did not affect the
normal use of org-fc.

** 0.3.2

*** Added

- Custom titles for the back heading can be configured via the
  ~org-fc-back-heading-titles~ variable.

  See [[./docs/card_types.org]] for instructions on how to add new titles.

** 0.3.1

*** Fixed

The dashboard should now correctly handles local variables and should
work as expected again.

** 0.3.0

*** Changed

The dashboard has been changed and split into collapsible sections,
some of which are visible from the start while others can be opened on
demand.

** 0.2.0
*** Added

- The ~org-fc-type-cloze-dwim~ command that can be used to mark regions
  in a file as cloze holes (contributed by Github user c1-g)

*** Fixed

- Results of the AWK indexer are parsed in a way that prevents an
  issue where some files would get ignored when indexing many files at
  once (contributed by Github user mithraen)

- The ~find~ command for searching org-mode files was improved to
  ignore directories with a name ending in =.org= (contributed by
  Github user vedang)

- When updating the review data drawer, ~delete-region~ is used
  instead of ~kill-region~ to avoid polluting the clipboard/kill-ring
  (contributed by sr.ht user bram85)

** 0.1.0
*** Added
- A ~org-fc-after-flip-hook~ that is run after a card is flipped
- Support for setting audio files to play after flipping a card via
  ~org-fc-audio-set-after-flip~

  argument, this has been fixed

*** [2020-05-01 Fri]
**** Internal
The AWK scripts now generate S-expressions instead of CSV tables, this
way ~read~ can be used to parse the data instead of relying on a set
of custom parsing functions.

This also allows passing more complex data structures from AWK to
org-fc.
*** [2020-04-29 Wed]
Implemented a new version of the spacing algorithm (SM2) that's used
by org-fc.

The only difference is in how the next interval for cards rated as
"hard" is calculate.

The initial version (~'sm2-v1~) would decrease the ease factor by
0.15, then calculate the next interval by multiplying the previous
interval with the new ease factor.

In the new version (~'sm2-v2~), the interval is always multiplied by a
factor of 1.2, similar to the version of SM2 used by Anki.

~org-fc-algorithm~ can be used to set which version of the
algorithm should be used, defaulting to ~'sm2-v1~.

Once I have evaluated the performance of the new algorithm,
the default version will change to ~'sm2-v2~.
*** [2020-04-12 Sun]

**** Internal
- ~org-fc-due-positions-for-paths~ now shuffles the lists of positions
  using an Emacs Lisp function instead of depending on =shuf=
- All awk-indexer functions now use ~gawk~ instead of ~awk~
